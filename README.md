  ## Title: 
 
 Node Logo Maker
  
 ## Description: 

In this project, I used inquirer to ask users questions for a desired shape, text (three letters), and color for each to be used as a generated logo on an svg file. A separate file (shapes.js) was used to for creating classes for the shapes circle, square, and triangle with text inside. Based on the user's inputs, the data would be filled into the template literals. This data would then sent back to the indexjs file and into the fswriteFile function. This would data would then be sent to the logo.svg file and displayed on the browser. There is also a shapes.test.js file that is used imports the classes from the shapes.js file and tests each of them.
