  ## Title: 
 
 Node Logo Maker
  
 ## Description: 

In this project, I used inquirer to ask users questions for a desired shape, text (three letters), and color for each to be used as a generated logo on an svg file. A separate file (shapes.js) was used for creating classes for the shapes: circle, square, and triangle with text inside. Based on the user's inputs, the data would be filled into the template literals within each class. This data would then be sent back to the index.js file and into the fs.writeFile function. This would data would then be sent to the logo.svg file and displayed on the browser. There is also a shapes.test.js file that is used by importing the classes from the shapes.js file and tests each of them.
